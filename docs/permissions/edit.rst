Mapping new groups to user environments
---------------------------------------

By default, users don't have access to any environment:

Admins can prepare a list of environments before assigning them to user groups.

Environments can be added on a group level by clicking on the ``Add Group`` button and selecting
the group using the dropdown menu:

------------------

Save the changes by clicking on the ``Submit`` button.

This will reload the page and show the updated list of permissions.
