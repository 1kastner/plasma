Writing Documentation
=====================

The documentation is available at `docs.plasmabio.org <https://docs.plasmabio.org>`_ and is written
with `Sphinx <https://sphinx-doc.org/>`_.

The Littlest JupyterHub has a good `overview page <https://the-littlest-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/docs.html>`_
on writing documentation, with externals links to the tools used to generate it.

First, create a new environment:

.. code-block:: bash

  conda create -n plasmabio-docs -c conda-forge python
  conda activate plasmabio-docs

In the ``docs`` folder, run:

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  make html

Open ``docs/_build/index.html`` in a browser to start browsing the documentation.

Rerun ``make html`` after making any changes to the source.
