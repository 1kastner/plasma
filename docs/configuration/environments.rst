User Environments
=================

User environments are built as immutable Docker images. The Docker images bundle the dependencies, extensions,
and predefined notebooks that should be available to all users.

PlasmaBio uses `repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io>`_ to build the images on the server.
